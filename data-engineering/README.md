# Resources for Google Data Engineering Course

- Andrij is the ML practice lead at Gartner and has written one of the best technical introduction and mid level book on machine learning. [Andrij Burkov - Hundred Page ML Book](http://themlbook.com/)
- This is a great book covering many of the business designs around machine learning before diving into the technology, which means that it covers a lot of the elements around covering the building of ML practices. [Andrew Ng - Deep Learning Yearning Book](https://www.deeplearning.ai/machine-learning-yearning/) (was at [Old URL](http://www.mlyearning.org/))
- This is a resource I have used extensively to learn and practice machine learning techniques on both the supervised and the unsupervised types of machine learning. [Data Camp (Paid Learning)](https://www.datacamp.com/home)
- Kaggle is a competition site with many great resources, bought by Google a few years ago. It is a great place to get sample datasets and ideas around solving real world problems. [Kaggle (Practice)](https://www.kaggle.com/)
- This is a must read for anyone working on large scale computing. This has a lot of practical detail in building a DevOps team. [Site Reliability Engineering](https://landing.google.com/sre/)
- This has been voted as one of the best technical books for ML with 36 odd models and designs with practical examples all the way from clustering to deep neural networks. [Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920052289.do)
